# Whitbread Product Developer Test

## Instructions to build the project

* **Cocoapods**

You need https://cocoapods.org to build the code. 
If you don’t have it installed, go to a terminal window and insert the following command:

$ sudo gem install cocoapods


## Rules

*   **You are able to use any language, platform, framework or libraries that you think are useful.** For web developers, we think that this is easiest to complete using HTML/JS/CSS. For app developers we expect it to be completed in a native language for your platform (Java, Swift, Objective-C etc).
*   Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow and any other websites or tutorials for inspiration but ensure it is your own solution that you submit.
*   Feel free to sign up as a Foursquare developer and create an app in order to use their services. Feel free to use the Foursquare public token available from trying out the API endpoints on the foursquare developer website (e.g. https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/users/search -> ’Try it out’)
*   **You should make it as easy as humanly possible to run your code. Instructions, included libraries, scripts etc should be included where appropriate.**
*   **Please submit your code by creating a repository on GitHub and providing us with the link to the repo.**
*   **You must check in your code at least once every 30mins.**
*   When you submit your code **you must send a summary (or have it as your readme.md) explaining the approach you have taken.**
